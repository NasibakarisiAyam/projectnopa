# TODO: Make Dashboard the Homepage

## Tasks
- [x] Update App.jsx to change the "/" route to render Dashboard with ProtectedRoute
- [x] Remove Navbar from the "/" route since Dashboard includes Header
- [x] Add calendar to dashboard showing dates with room bookings marked
- [x] Test the application to ensure routing works correctly (Backend running, but MongoDB connection issue noted)
- [ ] Optionally, remove or relocate Homepage.jsx if no longer needed
